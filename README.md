A Self-Organizing Map, or SOM, falls under the rare domain of unsupervised learning in Neural Networks. Its essentially a grid of neurons, each denoting one cluster learned during training. Traditionally speaking, there is no concept of neuron ‘locations’ in ANNs. However, in an SOM, each neuron has a location, and neurons that lie close to each other represent clusters with similar properties. Each neuron has a weightage vector, which is equal to the centroid of its particular cluster.
